## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you believe you have found a vulnerability, please refrain from creating an issue.  Instead you may contact me directly on my personal E-mail: ct.jcpm@gmail.com.  If you have any reason to believe that a user's personally identifiable information (PII) has been compromised, please IMMEDIATELY contact Chaturbate in addition to myself.

We take security seriously, and usually acknowledge reports within 48 hours.  You will recieve regular updates throughout our investigative process.  If the vulnerability was limited in scope to our system, we always support public disclosure.
